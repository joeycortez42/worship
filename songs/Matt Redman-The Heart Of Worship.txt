{c: Intro}
[D] [A] [Em7] [A]

{c: Verse 1}
[D]  When the music [A]fades all is stripped a-[Em7]way
And I simply [A]come
[D]  Longing just to [A]bring something that's of [Em7]worth
That will bless Your [A]heart

{c: Pre-Chorus}
[Em7]  I’ll bring You [D/F#]more than a [A]song    For a song in itself
[Em7]  Is not what [D/F#]You have re-[A]quired
[Em7]  You search much [D/F#]deeper with-[A]in    Through the way things appear
[Em7]  You’re looking [D/F#]into my [A]heart

{soc}
[D]  I’m coming back to the [A]heart of worship
And it’s [Em7]all about You   [G]All about [A]You Jesus
[D]  I’m sorry Lord for the [A]thing I’ve made it
When it’s [Em7]all about You   [G]All about [A]You Je-[D]sus   [D] [A] [Em7] [A]
{eoc}

{c: Verse 2}
[D]  King of endless [A]worth no one could ex-[Em7]press
How much You de-[A]serve
[D]  Though I’m weak and [A]poor all I have is [Em7]Yours
Ev’ry single [A]breath

{c: Pre-Chorus}
[Em7]  I’ll bring You [D/F#]more than a [A]song    For a song in itself
[Em7]  Is not what [D/F#]You have re-[A]quired

[Em7]  You’re looking [D/F#]into my [A]heart
