{c: Verse 1}
Even though I [A]walk through the valley   Of the shadow of death
Your [D]perfect love is casting out fear
And even when I'm [A]caught in the middle   Of the storms of this life
I [D]won't turn back I know You are near

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And I will fear no [F#m]e [E]- [A]vil   For my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me
And if my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me   Whom then shall I [E] fear
Whom then shall I [D] fear

{soc}
[A]Oh no You never let go   Through the calm and through the storm
[F#m]Oh no You never let go   In ev'ry high and ev'ry low
[E]Oh no You never let go   [D]Lord You never let go of me

{c: Verse 2}
And I can see a [A]light that is coming
For the heart that holds on
A [D]glorious light beyond all compare
And there will be an [A]end to these troubles
But until that day comes
We'll [D]live to know You here on the earth

{c: Pre-Chorus}
And I will fear no [F#m]e [E]- [A]vil   For my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me

Whom then shall I [D] fear
