[A]
#Verse 1
Even though I [A]walk through the valley
Of the shadow of death
Your [F#]perfect love is casting out fear
And even when I'm [A]caught in the middle
Of the storms of this life
I [D]won't turn back I know You are near

{c:Pre-Chorus}
And I will fear no [F#m]e [E]- [A]vil
For my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me
And if my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me
Whom then shall I [E] fear
Whom then shall I [D] fear

{soc}
[A]Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
[F#m]Oh no You never let go
In ev'ry high and ev'ry low
[E]Oh no You never let go
[D]Lord You never let go of me [A] [E] [D]
{eoc}

#Verse 2
And I can see a [A]light that is coming
For the heart that holds on
A [F#]glorious light beyond all compare
And there will be an [A]end to these troubles
But until that day comes
We'll [D]live to know You here on the earth

{c:Pre-Chorus}
And I will fear no [F#m]e [E]- [A]vil
For my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me
And if my God is [F#m]wi[E]th [A]me
Whom then shall I [E] fear
Whom then shall I [D] fear

{soc}
[A]Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
[F#m]Oh no You never let go
In ev'ry high and ev'ry low
[E]Oh no You never let go
[D]Lord You never let go of me
You [A]keep on runnin' and You never let go [E] [D]

[A]Oh no You never let go
Through the calm and through the storm
[F#m]Oh no You never let go
In ev'ry high and ev'ry low
[E]Oh no You never let go
[D]Lord You never let go of me [A] [E] [D]
{eoc}

{sob}
Yes I can see a [A]light
That is coming for the heart that holds on
And there will be an [F#m]end to these troubles
But until that day comes
[E]  Still I will praise You
[D] Still I will praise You [A] [E] [D]

Yes I can see a [A]light
That is coming for the heart that holds on
And there will be an [F#m]end to these troubles
But until that day comes
[E]  Still I will praise You
[D] Still I will praise You [A] [E] [D]
