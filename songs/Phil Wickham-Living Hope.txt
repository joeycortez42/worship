{c: Verse 1}
How great the [D]chasm     that lay be[Asus]tween us
How high the [G]mountain     [Bm]  I could not [Asus]climb
In desper[D]ation     I turned to [Asus]heaven
And spoke Your [G]name     in[Asus]to the [D]night

{c: Pre-Chorus}
Then through the [G]darkness     Your loving [D]kindness
Tore through the [Bm]shadows of my [A]soul
The work is [D]finished the end is [A]written
Jesus [G]Christ my [A]living [D]hope

[G]

{c: Verse 2}
Who could [D]imagine     so great a [Asus]mercy
What heart could [G]fathom     [Bm]   such boundless [Asus]grace
The God of [D]ages     stepped down from [Asus]glory
To wear my [G]sin     and [Asus]bear my [D]shame

{c: Pre-Chorus}
The cross has [G]spoken     I am for[D]given
The King of [Bm]kings calls me His [A]own
Beautiful [D]Savior I’m Yours for[A]ever
Jesus [G]Christ my [A]living [D]hope

There’s sal[A]vation in Your [Bm]name
Jesus [G]Christ my [A]living [D]hope

{c: Verse 3}
Then came the [D]morning     that sealed the [Asus]promise
Your buried [G]body     [Bm]   began to [Asus]breathe
Out of the [D]silence     the Roaring [Asus]Lion
Declared the [G]grave     has no [Asus]claim on [D]me
