{c: Verse 1}
[Em]   There's a grace when the [C]heart is under f[G]ire
[Em]   Another way when the [C]walls are closing i[G]n
[Em]   And when I look at the [C]space between
Where I [G]used to be and this [Bm7]reckoning
[Em]   I know I will [C]never be alone [G]

{soc}
There was another in the f[Em]ire
S[C]tanding next to m[G]e
There was another in the w[Em]aters
[C]Holding back the s[G]eas
And should I ever need rem[Em]inding
Of [C]how I've been set fr[G]ee
There is a cross that bears the b[Em]urden
Where a[C]nother died for me [G]
There is another in the f[Em]ire   [C]. . . .   [G]. . . . . . . .
{eoc}

{c: Verse 2}
[Em]   All my debt left for [C]dead beneath the w[G]aters
[Em]   I'm no longer a [C]slave to my sin an[G]ymore
[Em]   And should I fall in the [C]space between
What re[G]mains of me and this [Bm7]reckoning
[Em]   Either way I won't [C]bow to the things of th[G]is world
{c: Higher}
[Em]   And I know I will [C]never be al[G]one

{soc}
There is another in the f[Em]ire
S[C]tanding next to m[G]e
There is another in the w[Em]aters
[C]Holding back the s[G]eas
And should I ever need rem[Em]inding
What [C]power set me fr[G]ee
There is a grave that holds no b[Em]ody
Now that [C]power lives in m[G]e
{eoc}

There is another in the f[Em]ire [C]oh [G]
There is another in the f[Em]ire [C]oh [G]
There is another in the f[Em]ire [C]oh [G]
There is another in the f[Em]ire [C]oh [G]

{sob}
And I can see the [Em]light in the da[C]rkness
As the da[G]rkness bows to H[D]im
I can hear the [Em]roar in the h[C]eavens
As the sp[G]ace between wears th[D]in
I can feel the g[Em]round shake ben[C]eath us
As the pr[G]ison walls cave [D]in
Nothing stands be[Am7]tween us
Nothing stands be[C]tween [D]us
{eob}

{c: Verse 3 - Single Strum}
[Em]   There is no other [C]name
But the Name that is [G]Jesus
[Em]   He who was and still [C]is
And will be through it [G]all
[Em]   So come what may in the [C]space between
All the [G]things unseen and this [Bm7]reckoning
{c: Build}
[Em]   I know I will [C]never be alon[G]e
[Em]   I know I will [C]never be alon[G]e

There'll be another in the f[Em]ire
S[C]tanding next to m[G]e
There'll be another in the w[Em]aters
[C]Holding back the s[G]eas
Should I ever need rem[Em]inding
How [C]good You’ve been to m[G]e
I'll count the joy come ev'ry b[Em]attle
'Cause I [C]know that's where You'll be [G]
