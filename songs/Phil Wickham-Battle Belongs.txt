[G]

{c: Verse 1}
[G]     When all I see is the battle
You see my v[C2]ictory
[Em7]     When all I see is the mountain
You [D]see a mou[C2]ntain moved

{c: Verse 2}
[G]     And as I walk through the shadow
Your love surro[C2]unds me
[Em7]     There’s nothing to fear now
For [D]I     am sa[G]fe     with You

{soc}
So when I [C2]fight     I’ll [G]fight on my kn[D]ees
With my [Em7]hands lifted h[C2]igh
Oh [G]God     the battle be[D]longs to Y[Em7]ou
And every [C2]fear I   [G]lay at Your f[D]eet
I’ll [Em7]sing through the n[C2]ight
Oh [G]God the battle be[D]longs to You
{eoc}

[G]. . . .     [G]. . . .

{c: Verse 3}
[G]     And if You are for me
Who can be aga[C2]inst me
[Em7]     For Jesus there’s nothing
Im[D]possible [C2]    for You

{c: Verse 4}
[G]     When all I see are the ashes
You see the bea[C2]uty
[Em7]     When all I see is a cross
God You [D]see the em[G]pty tomb

{soc}
So when I [C2]fight     I’ll [G]fight on my kn[D]ees
With my [Em7]hands lifted h[C2]igh
Oh [G]God     the battle be[D]longs to Y[Em7]ou
And every [C2]fear I   [G]lay at Your f[D]eet
I’ll [Em7]sing through the n[C2]ight
Oh [G]God the battle be[D]longs to You
