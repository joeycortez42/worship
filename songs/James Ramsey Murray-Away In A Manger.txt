The [A]lit-tle Lord [D]Je-sus   a-[G]sleep on [A]the [D]hay

{c:Verse 1}
A-[D]way in a man-ger no   [G]crib for a [D]bed
The [A]little Lord Jesus laid [D]down His sweet head
The [D]stars in the sky looked [G]down where He [D]lay
The [A]lit-tle Lord [D]Jesus   a-[G]sleep on [A]the [D]hay

{c:Verse 2}
The [D]cat-tle are low-ing   the [G]Baby a-[D]wakes
But [A]lit-tle Lord Jesus   no [D]crying He makes
I [D]love Thee Lord Je-sus   look [G]down from the [D]sky
And [A]stay by my [D]cra-dle 'til [G]morning [A]is [D]nigh

{c:Verse 3}
Be [D]near me Lord Je-sus   I [G]ask Thee to [D]stay
Close [A]by me forever and [D]love me I pray
Bless [D]all the dear children in [G]Thy tender [D]care
And [A]take us to [D]heav-en   to [G]live with [A]Thee [D]there

Be [D]near me Lord Je-sus   I [G]ask Thee to [D]stay
Close [A]by me forever and [D]love me I pray
Bless [D]all the dear children in [G]Thy tender [D]care
And [A]take us to [D]heav-en   to [G]live with [A]Thee [D]there

{c:Ending}
And [A]take us to [D]heav-en   to [G]live with [A]Thee [D]there
